Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
a) Reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
b) Efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
 c) Scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
 d) Security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) Mastering the machine- the first compilers were defined, operating systems were noninteractive and the main purpose of any piece of software was to optimize exploitation of the limited hardware resources.
b) Mastering the Process- aim was to reduce risk during development and improve quality and productivity, ensure correctness.
c) Mastering complexity- the software development process would now comprehensively address analysis and design from specification 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Planning- define the software's purpose and scope 
b) Requirements analysis- gather and document user expectationss
c) Design- create the software's architecture and user interfaces
d) Coding- develop the software by writing code 
e) Testing- identify and fix bugs to ensure quality
f) Deployment- release the software to users
g) Maintenance- ccontinuously support and improve the software post-deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
- Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
- Testing is done at the end of the development process.

Example scenario: waterfall is suitable for projects with well-defined and stable requirements, such as building a bridge or physical product where changes are costly and tim-consuming
Agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Example scenario: agile is appropriate for software development with evolving or unclear requirements, where rapid adaptation to changes and continuous feedback are essential, such as developing a new mobile app or web-based service


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
